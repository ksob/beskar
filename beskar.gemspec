  spec.description = "Rails Security Shield is a comprehensive, Rails-native security engine designed to provide multi-layered protection for modern web applications. It actively defends against common threats by integrating a powerful Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block attacks like SQLi and XSS, an advanced bot detection system using JavaScript challenges and honeypots, and robust account takeover prevention to stop brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.

Built as a mountable Rails Engine, it leverages core framework features like ActiveJob and Rails.cache to ensure high performance and minimal external dependencies. It includes a real-time dashboard for monitoring security events, giving you immediate insight into the threats your application faces. Drop it in, configure it, and get enterprise-grade security that feels like a natural extension of Rails."
