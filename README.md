# Beskar

**Beskar** is a comprehensive, Rails-native security engine designed to provide multi-layered, proactive protection for modern web applications. It defends against common threats, bot activity, and account takeovers without requiring external dependencies, integrating seamlessly into your application as a natural extension of the framework.

## Features

-   **Devise Integration:** Seamless integration with Devise authentication for automatic login tracking and security analysis.
-   **Risk-Based Account Locking:** Automatically locks accounts when authentication risk scores exceed configurable thresholds, preventing compromised account access.
-   **Smart Rate Limiting:** Distributed rate limiting using Rails.cache with IP-based and account-based throttling with exponential backoff.
-   **Brute Force Detection:** Advanced pattern recognition to detect single account attacks vs credential stuffing attempts, with automatic IP banning.
-   **IP Whitelisting:** Allow trusted IPs (office networks, partners, security scanners) to bypass blocking while maintaining full audit logs. Supports individual IPs and CIDR notation.
-   **Persistent IP Blocking:** Hybrid cache + database blocking system that survives application restarts. Auto-bans IPs after authentication abuse or excessive rate limiting violations.
-   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Real-time detection and blocking of vulnerability scanning attempts across 7 attack categories (WordPress, PHP admin panels, config files, path traversal, framework debug, CMS detection, common exploits). Includes escalating ban durations and monitor-only mode.
-   **Security Event Tracking:** Comprehensive logging of authentication events with risk scoring and metadata extraction.
-   **IP Geolocation:** MaxMind GeoLite2-City database integration for country/city location, coordinates, timezone, and enhanced risk scoring (configurable, database not included due to licensing).
-   **Geographic Anomaly Detection:** Haversine-based impossible travel detection and location-based risk assessment.
-   **Advanced Bot Detection:** Multi-layered defense using JavaScript challenges and invisible honeypots to filter out malicious bots while allowing legitimate ones.
-   **Modular Architecture:** Devise-specific code is isolated in separate services for maintainability and extensibility.
-   **Rails-Native Architecture:** Built as a mountable `Rails::Engine`, it leverages `ActiveJob` and `Rails.cache` for high performance and low overhead.
-   **Real-Time Dashboard (Coming Soon):** A mountable dashboard to visualize security events and monitor threats as they happen.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'beskar'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Run the installation task to set up Beskar:

```bash
bin/rails beskar:install
```

This will:
- Copy all necessary migrations to your application
- Create `config/initializers/beskar.rb` with sensible defaults
- Display next steps for completing the setup

Then run the database migrations:

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### Quick Start

By default, Beskar enables the **Web Application Firewall (WAF) in monitor-only mode**. This means:
- ✅ Vulnerability scans are detected and logged
- ✅ Security events are created for analysis  
- ⚠️ No requests are blocked yet (safe to enable in production)

After monitoring for 24-48 hours, review the logs and disable monitor-only mode to enable active blocking:

```ruby
# config/initializers/beskar.rb
config.waf = {
  enabled: true,
  monitor_only: false,  # Change this to enable blocking
  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

### Add to Your User Model

Include the `SecurityTrackable` concern in your Devise user model:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Beskar::SecurityTrackable
  
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
  # ... other Devise modules
end
```

## Configuration

You can configure Beskar in the initializer file created by the installer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/beskar.rb
Beskar.configure do |config|
  # === Security Tracking ===
  # Controls what security events are tracked and analyzed
  config.security_tracking = {
    enabled: true,                    # Master switch - disables all tracking when false
    track_successful_logins: true,    # Track successful authentication events
    track_failed_logins: true,        # Track failed authentication attempts
    auto_analyze_patterns: true       # Enable automatic pattern analysis for threats
  }

  # === Rate Limiting ===
  config.rate_limiting = {
    ip_attempts: {
      limit: 10,                    # Max attempts per IP
      period: 1.hour,               # Time window
      exponential_backoff: true     # Enable exponential backoff
    },
    account_attempts: {
      limit: 5,                     # Max attempts per account
      period: 15.minutes,           # Time window
      exponential_backoff: true
    },
    global_attempts: {
      limit: 100,                   # System-wide limit
      period: 1.minute,
      exponential_backoff: false
    }
  }

  # === IP Whitelisting ===
  # Allow trusted IPs to bypass all blocking (bans, rate limits, WAF)
  # while still logging all activity for audit purposes
  config.ip_whitelist = [
    "192.168.1.100",      # Single IP address
    "10.0.0.0/24",        # CIDR notation - entire subnet
    "172.16.0.0/16",      # Larger CIDR range
    "2001:db8::/32"       # IPv6 support
  ]

  # === Web Application Firewall (WAF) ===
  # Real-time detection and blocking of vulnerability scanning attempts
  config.waf = {
    enabled: true,                        # Master switch for WAF
    auto_block: true,                     # Automatically ban IPs after threshold
    block_threshold: 3,                   # Number of violations before blocking
    violation_window: 1.hour,             # Time window for counting violations
    block_durations: [1.hour, 6.hours, 24.hours, 7.days], # Escalating ban durations
    permanent_block_after: 5,             # Permanent ban after N violations
    create_security_events: true,         # Log WAF violations to SecurityEvent table
    monitor_only: false                   # If true, log violations but never block
  }

  # === Risk-Based Account Locking ===
  # Automatically lock accounts when authentication risk score exceeds threshold
  config.risk_based_locking = {
    enabled: false,                    # Master switch for risk-based locking
    risk_threshold: 75,                # Lock account if risk score >= this value (0-100)
    lock_strategy: :devise_lockable,   # Strategy: :devise_lockable, :custom, :none
    auto_unlock_time: 1.hour,          # Time until automatic unlock (if supported)
    notify_user: true,                 # Send notification on lock (future feature)
    log_lock_events: true              # Create security event for locks
  }

  # === IP Geolocation ===
  # Configure IP geolocation for enhanced risk assessment
  # Note: You must provide your own MaxMind GeoLite2-City database due to licensing
  # Download from: https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data
  config.geolocation = {
    provider: :maxmind,                # Provider: :maxmind or :mock (for testing)
    maxmind_city_db_path: Rails.root.join('db', 'geoip', 'GeoLite2-City.mmdb').to_s,
    cache_ttl: 4.hours                 # How long to cache geolocation results
  }
end

# Security Tracking Configuration Details
The security tracking system respects all configuration settings:

- **`enabled: false`** - Completely disables all security event tracking
- **`track_successful_logins: false`** - Stops tracking successful login events
- **`track_failed_logins: false`** - Stops tracking failed login attempts  
- **`auto_analyze_patterns: false`** - Disables automatic threat pattern analysis

When tracking is disabled via configuration, no `SecurityEvent` records are created and no background analysis jobs are queued.
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Once installed and configured, Beskar works automatically with Devise. Add the `SecurityTrackable` module to your User model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
  
  # Add Beskar security tracking
  include Beskar::Models::SecurityTrackable
end
```

### Risk-Based Account Locking (with Devise Lockable)

Beskar can automatically lock user accounts when the calculated risk score exceeds a configured threshold. This prevents compromised accounts from being accessed even after successful authentication.

**Setup with Devise Lockable:**

1. Enable the `:lockable` module in your User model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable,
         :lockable  # Add this for risk-based locking
  
  include Beskar::Models::SecurityTrackable
end
```

2. Generate and run the migration to add lockable columns:

```bash
rails generate devise User  # This will add lockable columns if not present
# Or manually add:
# - failed_attempts (integer)
# - unlock_token (string)
# - locked_at (datetime)
rails db:migrate
```

3. Enable risk-based locking in your initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/beskar.rb
Beskar.configure do |config|
  config.risk_based_locking = {
    enabled: true,                     # Enable the feature
    risk_threshold: 75,                # Lock when risk >= 75
    lock_strategy: :devise_lockable,   # Use Devise's lockable module
    auto_unlock_time: 1.hour,          # Automatic unlock after 1 hour
    notify_user: true,                 # Log notification intent
    log_lock_events: true              # Create security events
  }
end
```

**How it works:**

- After each successful authentication, Beskar calculates a risk score (0-100) based on:
  - Geographic anomalies (impossible travel, country changes)
  - Device fingerprints (suspicious user agents, bot signatures)
  - Login patterns (velocity, time of day, recent failures)
  - IP reputation and geolocation risk

- **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from user behavior:
  - After 2+ successful logins from an IP, that location becomes "established"
  - If a user unlocks and logs in successfully, that pattern is trusted
  - Risk scores are reduced to 30% for established patterns (capped at 25)
  - This prevents repeated locks after users validate their login context

- If the risk score meets or exceeds the configured threshold, the account is automatically locked
- The user session is terminated immediately to prevent access
- A security event is logged with the lock reason and risk details (always logged for audit trail)
- The account remains locked until manually unlocked or the auto-unlock time expires (if supported)

**Example Adaptive Flow:**
1. User travels to new location → High risk (85) → Account locked
2. User unlocks account → Validates legitimacy
3. User logs in from same location → Pattern established → Risk reduced to 25 → Login succeeds ✅
4. Future logins from this location → Normal risk → No more locks

See `ADAPTIVE_LEARNING.md` for detailed documentation.

**Lock Reasons:**

The system identifies specific reasons for locking:
- `:impossible_travel` - Login from location requiring impossible travel speed
- `:suspicious_device` - Bot signature or suspicious user agent detected
- `:geographic_anomaly` - Country change or high-risk location
- `:high_risk_authentication` - General high-risk authentication pattern

**Manual Lock/Unlock Operations:**

```ruby
# Manually lock an account based on risk
locker = Beskar::Services::AccountLocker.new(
  user,
  risk_score: 85,
  reason: :suspicious_device,
  metadata: { ip_address: request.ip }
)

if locker.should_lock?
  locker.lock!  # Lock the account
end

# Check if account is locked
locker.locked?  # => true/false

# Manually unlock
locker.unlock!
```

### Security Event Tracking

Beskar automatically tracks login attempts and creates security events with rich metadata:

```ruby
# Check recent failed attempts for a user
user.recent_failed_attempts(within: 1.hour)

# Check if user has suspicious login patterns
user.suspicious_login_pattern?

# Get recent successful logins
user.recent_successful_logins(within: 24.hours)

# Access security events
user.security_events.login_failures.recent
```

### Rate Limiting

Check if a request should be rate limited:

```ruby
# In a controller or middleware
if Beskar.rate_limited?(request, current_user)
  render json: { error: 'Rate limit exceeded' }, status: 429
  return
end

# Manual rate limiting check
rate_limiter = Beskar::Services::RateLimiter.new(request.ip, current_user)
unless rate_limiter.allowed?
  # Handle rate limiting
  time_until_reset = rate_limiter.time_until_reset
end
```

### Security Events Analysis

Security events are automatically created and include:

- **Event Type**: `login_success`, `login_failure`
- **IP Address**: Client IP with proxy detection
- **User Agent**: Browser and device information
- **Risk Score**: 0-100 based on various factors
- **Metadata**: Device info, geolocation, timestamps
- **Attack Patterns**: Detection of brute force, credential stuffing, etc.

### Attack Pattern Detection

Beskar can identify different types of attacks:

```ruby
rate_limiter = Beskar::Services::RateLimiter.new(ip_address, user)
attack_type = rate_limiter.attack_pattern_type

case attack_type
when :brute_force_single_account
  # Single IP attacking one account
when :distributed_single_account  
  # Multiple IPs attacking one account
when :single_ip_multiple_accounts
  # One IP attacking multiple accounts (credential stuffing)
when :mixed_attack_pattern
  # Complex attack pattern
end
```

### IP Whitelisting

Whitelist trusted IPs to bypass all security blocking while maintaining full audit logs:

```ruby
# In config/initializers/beskar.rb
Beskar.configure do |config|
  config.ip_whitelist = [
    "203.0.113.0/24",      # Office network (CIDR notation)
    "198.51.100.50",       # VPN gateway (single IP)
    "2001:db8::1"          # IPv6 address
  ]
end
```

**How it works:**
- Whitelisted IPs bypass **all blocking** (banned IPs, rate limits, WAF violations)
- All requests from whitelisted IPs are **still logged** for audit purposes
- Supports individual IPs and CIDR notation (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Configuration is validated on startup
- Efficient caching for high-performance checks

**Check if an IP is whitelisted:**
```ruby
if Beskar::Services::IpWhitelist.whitelisted?(request.ip)
  # IP is trusted - allow but log activity
end

# Clear whitelist cache after config changes
Beskar::Services::IpWhitelist.clear_cache!
```

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Beskar's WAF detects and blocks vulnerability scanning attempts across 7 attack categories:

**Attack Categories Detected:**
1. **WordPress Scans** (High Severity) - `/wp-admin`, `/wp-login.php`, `/xmlrpc.php`
2. **PHP Admin Panels** (High Severity) - `/phpmyadmin`, `/admin.php`, `/phpinfo.php`
3. **Config Files** (Critical Severity) - `/.env`, `/.git`, `/database.yml`
4. **Path Traversal** (Critical Severity) - `/../../../etc/passwd`, URL encoded variants
5. **Framework Debug** (Medium Severity) - `/rails/info/routes`, `/__debug__`, `/telescope`
6. **CMS Detection** (Medium Severity) - `/joomla`, `/drupal`, `/magento`
7. **Common Exploits** (Critical Severity) - `/shell.php`, `/c99.php`, `/webshell`

**Configuration Examples:**

```ruby
# Production - Aggressive protection
Beskar.configure do |config|
  config.waf = {
    enabled: true,
    auto_block: true,
    block_threshold: 2,              # Block after just 2 violations
    violation_window: 30.minutes,
    block_durations: [6.hours, 24.hours, 7.days, 30.days],
    permanent_block_after: 4,
    create_security_events: true
  }
end

# Development - Monitor only
Beskar.configure do |config|
  config.waf = {
    enabled: true,
    monitor_only: true,              # Log but never block
    create_security_events: true
  }
  
  config.ip_whitelist = ["127.0.0.1", "::1"]  # Whitelist localhost
end
```

**Blocking Behavior:**
- **First violation**: Logged, violation count incremented
- **Threshold reached** (default 3): IP automatically banned for 1 hour
- **Repeat violations**: Ban duration escalates: 1h → 6h → 24h → 7d → **permanent**
- **Permanent block**: After 5 violations (configurable), IP is permanently banned
- **Monitor mode**: Logs all violations but never blocks (useful for tuning)

**Check WAF status:**
```ruby
# Check if WAF detected threats
violation_count = Beskar::Services::Waf.get_violation_count(ip_address)

# Reset violations (admin action)
Beskar::Services::Waf.reset_violations(ip_address)

# Analyze a request without blocking
waf_analysis = Beskar::Services::Waf.analyze_request(request)
if waf_analysis
  puts "Detected: #{waf_analysis[:patterns].map { |p| p[:description] }}"
  puts "Severity: #{waf_analysis[:highest_severity]}"
  puts "Risk Score: #{waf_analysis[:risk_score]}"
end
```

### IP Blocking and Banning

Beskar uses a hybrid cache + database blocking system that persists across application restarts.

**Automatic IP Banning:**

IPs are automatically banned for:
1. **Authentication abuse** - 10+ failed login attempts in 1 hour
2. **Rate limit violations** - 5+ rate limit violations in 1 hour
3. **WAF violations** - 3+ vulnerability scan attempts (configurable)

**Manual IP Management:**

```ruby
# Ban an IP address
Beskar::BannedIp.ban!(
  "203.0.113.50",
  reason: "manual_block",
  duration: 24.hours,
  details: "Suspicious activity reported by admin",
  metadata: { reporter: "admin@example.com", ticket: "#12345" }
)

# Permanent ban
Beskar::BannedIp.ban!(
  "203.0.113.51",
  reason: "confirmed_attack",
  permanent: true,
  details: "Confirmed malicious actor"
)

# Check if IP is banned
Beskar::BannedIp.banned?("203.0.113.50")  # => true

# Unban an IP
Beskar::BannedIp.unban!("203.0.113.50")

# Extend existing ban
ban = Beskar::BannedIp.find_by(ip_address: "203.0.113.50")
ban.extend_ban!(12.hours)  # Add 12 hours to current expiry
```

**Query banned IPs:**

```ruby
# Get all active bans
Beskar::BannedIp.active

# Get permanent bans
Beskar::BannedIp.permanent

# Get expired bans (not enforced but in database)
Beskar::BannedIp.expired

# Find bans by reason
Beskar::BannedIp.where(reason: 'waf_violation')
Beskar::BannedIp.where(reason: 'authentication_abuse')
Beskar::BannedIp.where(reason: 'rate_limit_abuse')

# Cleanup expired bans from database
removed_count = Beskar::BannedIp.cleanup_expired!
```

**Preload cache on startup:**

The cache is automatically preloaded when your app starts, but you can manually trigger it:

```ruby
# In config/initializers/beskar.rb (optional - happens automatically)
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Beskar::BannedIp.preload_cache!
end
```

### Security Events and Monitoring

**Query WAF violations:**

```ruby
# Recent WAF violations
waf_events = Beskar::SecurityEvent
  .where(event_type: 'waf_violation')
  .where('created_at > ?', 24.hours.ago)
  .order(created_at: :desc)

# High-risk WAF events
high_risk = Beskar::SecurityEvent
  .where(event_type: 'waf_violation')
  .where('risk_score >= ?', 80)
  .includes(:user)

# Group by IP to find repeat offenders
repeat_offenders = Beskar::SecurityEvent
  .where(event_type: 'waf_violation')
  .where('created_at > ?', 7.days.ago)
  .group(:ip_address)
  .having('COUNT(*) >= ?', 5)
  .count

# WAF violations by pattern type
waf_events.each do |event|
  patterns = event.metadata['waf_analysis']['patterns']
  patterns.each do |pattern|
    puts "#{event.ip_address}: #{pattern['category']} - #{pattern['description']}"
  end
end
```

**Scheduled maintenance:**

```ruby
# In a background job (e.g., daily)
class SecurityCleanupJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform
    # Remove expired bans from database
    removed = Beskar::BannedIp.cleanup_expired!
    Rails.logger.info "Cleaned up #{removed} expired IP bans"
    
    # Archive old security events (optional)
    Beskar::SecurityEvent.where('created_at < ?', 90.days.ago).delete_all
    
    # Generate security report (example)
    report = {
      active_bans: Beskar::BannedIp.active.count,
      permanent_bans: Beskar::BannedIp.permanent.count,
      waf_violations_today: Beskar::SecurityEvent.where(
        event_type: 'waf_violation',
        created_at: 24.hours.ago..Time.current
      ).count
    }
    
    # Send to monitoring service
    Rails.logger.info "Security Report: #{report}"
  end
end
```

### Middleware Integration

Beskar automatically injects its middleware (`Beskar::Middleware::RequestAnalyzer`) into the Rails stack to provide comprehensive request-level protection.

**Request Processing Order:**

Every request passes through these security checks in order:

1. **Whitelist Check** - Determine if IP is whitelisted (bypasses blocking but still logs)
2. **Banned IP Check** - Block immediately if IP is banned (403 Forbidden)
3. **Rate Limiting** - Check rate limits (429 Too Many Requests if exceeded)
4. **WAF Analysis** - Scan for vulnerability patterns (403 Forbidden if detected and threshold met)
5. **Request Processing** - Continue to application if all checks pass

**Features:**
- **Early exit** - Banned IPs are blocked immediately for performance
- **Whitelist bypass** - Trusted IPs bypass all blocking but activity is logged
- **Auto-blocking** - Automatic IP banning after:
  - 10+ failed authentication attempts (authentication abuse)
  - 5+ rate limit violations in 1 hour (rate limit abuse)
  - 3+ WAF violations (configurable, vulnerability scanning)
- **Custom error pages** - Returns helpful 403/429 error responses
- **Response headers** - Adds `X-Beskar-Blocked` and `X-Beskar-Rate-Limited` headers
- **Graceful degradation** - Continues working if cache is unavailable

**Middleware Logs:**

The middleware generates structured log messages for monitoring:

```
[Beskar::Middleware] Blocked request from banned IP: 203.0.113.50
[Beskar::Middleware] Rate limit exceeded for IP: 203.0.113.51
[Beskar::Middleware] WAF violation from whitelisted IP 192.168.1.100 (not blocking): WordPress vulnerability scan
[Beskar::Middleware] 🔒 Auto-blocked IP 203.0.113.52 after 3 WAF violations (duration: 1 hours)
[Beskar::Middleware] 🔒 Auto-blocked IP 203.0.113.53 for authentication brute force (15 failures)
```

Security events are logged to the `beskar_security_events` table for analysis and will be visualized in the forthcoming security dashboard.

## WAF Pattern Reference

| Category | Severity | Example Patterns | Risk Score |
|----------|----------|------------------|------------|
| WordPress Scans | High | `/wp-admin`, `/wp-login.php`, `/xmlrpc.php` | 80 |
| PHP Admin Panels | High | `/phpmyadmin`, `/admin.php`, `/phpinfo.php` | 80 |
| Config Files | **Critical** | `/.env`, `/.git`, `/database.yml`, `/config.php` | **95** |
| Path Traversal | **Critical** | `/../../../etc/passwd`, `%2e%2e/` | **95** |
| Framework Debug | Medium | `/rails/info/routes`, `/__debug__`, `/telescope` | 60 |
| CMS Detection | Medium | `/joomla`, `/drupal`, `/magento` | 60 |
| Common Exploits | **Critical** | `/shell.php`, `/c99.php`, `/webshell` | **95** |

**Pattern matching is:**
- Case-insensitive
- Works on full path including query strings
- Detects URL-encoded variants
- Can match multiple patterns per request

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Start with Monitor Mode

When first enabling WAF, use monitor-only mode to tune thresholds:

```ruby
config.waf = {
  enabled: true,
  monitor_only: true,  # Log but don't block
  create_security_events: true
}
```

After reviewing logs for false positives, enable blocking:

```ruby
config.waf = {
  enabled: true,
  monitor_only: false,
  auto_block: true
}
```

### 2. Whitelist Carefully

Only whitelist truly trusted IPs:

```ruby
# ✅ Good - Documented, legitimate sources
config.ip_whitelist = [
  "203.0.113.0/24",    # Office network - IT approved
  "198.51.100.50"      # VPN gateway - documented in wiki
]

# ❌ Bad - Whitelisting unknown IPs
config.ip_whitelist = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Never do this!
```

### 3. Regular Maintenance

Set up a scheduled job to clean up old data:

```ruby
# Schedule daily via cron or Sidekiq
SecurityCleanupJob.perform_later

# Or in initializer for quick cleanup on restart
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Beskar::BannedIp.cleanup_expired! if Rails.env.production?
end
```

### 4. Monitor Security Events

Set up alerts for high-risk events:

```ruby
# Example monitoring
high_risk_count = Beskar::SecurityEvent
  .where('created_at > ?', 1.hour.ago)
  .where('risk_score >= ?', 80)
  .count

alert_service.notify if high_risk_count > 10
```

### 5. Document Whitelist Changes

Keep a record of why each IP is whitelisted:

```ruby
# config/initializers/beskar.rb
config.ip_whitelist = [
  "203.0.113.0/24",    # Office HQ network (added 2024-01-15, ticket #1234)
  "198.51.100.50",     # Partner API server (added 2024-02-01, contract #5678)
  "192.0.2.10"         # Security scanner (added 2024-03-01, vendor: SecurityCo)
]
```

### 6. Test WAF in Staging

Before deploying to production, test WAF rules in staging to catch false positives.

### 7. Review Ban Reasons

Periodically review banned IPs to ensure blocking is working correctly:

```ruby
# Check recent auto-bans
recent_bans = Beskar::BannedIp
  .where('created_at > ?', 7.days.ago)
  .group(:reason)
  .count

# Review specific ban details
waf_bans = Beskar::BannedIp.where(reason: 'waf_violation')
waf_bans.each do |ban|
  puts "#{ban.ip_address}: #{ban.details} (violations: #{ban.violation_count})"
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Legitimate users being blocked

**Solution:** Add their IP to whitelist or reduce WAF `block_threshold`:

```ruby
config.waf[:block_threshold] = 5  # Increase from default 3
```

Or whitelist specific IPs:
```ruby
config.ip_whitelist = ["user.ip.address.here"]
```

### Issue: Too many false positives

**Solution:** Enable monitor-only mode and review patterns:

```ruby
config.waf[:monitor_only] = true

# Review what's being flagged
Beskar::SecurityEvent.where(event_type: 'waf_violation').last(20).each do |event|
  puts "Path: #{event.metadata['request_path']}"
  puts "Patterns: #{event.metadata['waf_analysis']['patterns']}"
end
```

### Issue: Banned IPs persist after restart

**Solution:** This is intentional (database persistence). To unban:

```ruby
Beskar::BannedIp.unban!("ip.address.here")

# Or unban all expired
Beskar::BannedIp.cleanup_expired!
```

### Issue: Performance concerns

**Solution:** Beskar uses cache-first architecture. Ensure cache is configured:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, { url: ENV['REDIS_URL'] }
```

Check cache health:
```ruby
Rails.cache.read("test_key")  # Should work
Beskar::BannedIp.preload_cache!  # Reload from database if needed
```

## Migration from Previous Versions

If upgrading from a version without WAF/IP blocking features:

```bash
# Run new migrations
rails db:migrate

# Preload cache with existing bans (if any)
rails runner "Beskar::BannedIp.preload_cache!"

# Test in development first
RAILS_ENV=development rails server

# Review logs for any issues
tail -f log/development.log | grep Beskar
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Whitelist check**: O(n) where n = whitelist size, cached, < 1ms
- **Banned IP check**: O(1) cache lookup, < 1ms
- **Rate limit check**: O(1) cache lookup, < 1ms
- **WAF analysis**: O(m) where m = number of patterns, < 5ms
- **Total middleware overhead**: Typically < 10ms per request

**Scalability:**
- Handles 1000s of requests/second
- Cache-first architecture minimizes database queries
- Efficient pattern matching with compiled regexes
- Parallel test execution: 352 tests run in < 3 seconds

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. The gem contains a dummy Rails application in `test/dummy` for development and testing.

To run the test suite, use the standard Rails command:

```bash
# From the gem's root directory
$ bin/rails test
```
